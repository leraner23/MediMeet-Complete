       <h2>Limit sugary drinks</h2>
       <p>Sugar-sweetened beverages are also uniquely harmful for children, as they can contribute not only to obesity in children but also to conditions that usually do not develop until adulthood,
           like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease </p>
       <p>Healthier alternatives include:
       <ol>
           <li>water</li>
           <li>unsweetened teas</li>
           <li>coffee</li>
       </ol>

        <h2>Avoid bright lights before sleep</h2>
        <p>Some ways to help reduce your blue light exposure is to wear blue light blocking glasses — especially if you use a computer or other digital screen for long periods of time
            — and to avoid digital screens for 30 minutes to an hour before going to bed</p>

        <h2>Get moving</h2>
        <p>Doing aerobic exercise, or cardio, is one of the best things you can do for your mental and physical health.

            It’s particularly effective at reducing belly fat, the harmful type of fat that builds up around your organs.
            Reduced belly fat may lead to major improvements in your metabolic health</p>
